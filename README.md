## Project Structure
- `cut_eval`: provided file structure for evaluation
- `data`: provided reference files to use for implementing model, filters, features, EDA etc.
- `models`: implemented models
- `notebooks`: code files, both .ipynb and .py. `main.py` is the culmination of all work
- `utils`: utility functions, both provided and implemented

**Note**: All code files that we've implemented starts with one or more group member names to indicate his contribution. Sometimes, 'Exploration' is also written at the top to indicate explorative work that was necessary but may not have been a part of final solution.
